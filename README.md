# Snake Game

A snake game made using Turtle, Time and Random modules.

- The code is divided into three classes - snake, food and scoreboard.
- The snake starts moving in the right direction once the screen is clicked.
- The movement of the snake is solely based on key movements. 
    - "up" for going upwards.
    - "down" for going downwards.
    - "left" for going left.
    - "right" for going right.
- If the snake hits the wall, it comes out from the opposite side.
- With every food bite, the size of the snake keeps increasing and the score keeps increasing.
- Once the snake hits itself, the score resets and the snake's position also resets.
